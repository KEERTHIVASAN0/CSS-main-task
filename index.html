        <p class="italic"><b>Reading is a very good habit that one needs to develop in life.
           Good books can inform you, enlighten you and lead you in the right direction. 
           There is no better companion than a good book. Reading is important because it is good for your overall well-being.
            Once you start reading, you experience a whole new world. When you start loving the habit of reading you eventually get addicted to it.
             Reading develops language skills and vocabulary. Reading books is also a way to relax and reduce stress. 
             It is important to read a good book at least for a few minutes each day to stretch the brain muscles for healthy functioning.</b></p>
